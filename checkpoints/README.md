# Checkpoints directory

Place pretrained and trained weights under `checkpoints/` (not tracked by git).

Suggested layout:

- `checkpoints/vanilla/MVSplat/re10k.ckpt`
- `checkpoints/vanilla/ELIC/ELIC_*.pth.tar`
- (Optional, training-only) `checkpoints/gmdepth-scale1-resumeflowthings-scannet-5d9d7964.pth`

See `docs/INSTALL.md` for pointers on where each file comes from.
